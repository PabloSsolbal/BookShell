## Overview

- This application allows me to maintain two separate lists: my library and wishlist.
- It fetches real-time book data from designated API endpoints.
- The interface is responsive, making it accessible across devices.

## How It Works

1. **Library and Wishlist Views**: Upon loading, viewers are presented with two buttons, "Library" and "Wishlist." Clicking "Library" displays my book collection in the library, while "Wishlist" shows books on my wishlist.

2. **Browse Books**: In either the library or wishlist view, the app organizes books into categories based on read status (read or unread).

3. **Switch Views**: Viewers can switch between library and wishlist views at any time by clicking the corresponding buttons.
