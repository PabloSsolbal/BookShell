# Bookshell

Welcome to my personal project repository, Bookshell. This project consists of a small front-end project as a reading interface, a very simple API to communicate with the front-end and manage the cloud-hosted database, and finally a personal CLI that allows me to perform various CRUD operations on my database. It's a small project where I had the opportunity to use different technologies and connect everything to make it functional.

## About

The idea for this project came about because I enjoy reading a lot and needed a way to organize my books. While there are many applications where I could have done that, I decided to develop something personally. That's when I set up the CLI and used a local Mongo database. After that, some people asked me for my book list, so to practice some things and put together a good project, I decided to set up an API and create a web interface to display my list of books. This way, I only need to share a link to view the updated list.

## Project Elements

Information about the different elements that make up the project: interface, API, and CLI. Each component has its respective documentation if you want to know more about them.

1. **Front-End Interface**
    - **Description:** Built with core web technologies, it's a simple interface that requests data from the API and constructs elements in the document. Minimalistic and straightforward.
    - **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

2. **Back-End API**
    - **Description:** A simple API built with FastAPI that manages the Mongo DB to pass requested data to the front-end interface.
    - **Technologies Used:** FastAPI

3. **CLI**
    - **Description:** The most comprehensive component, built in pure Python, is a CLI that handles CRUD operations. It offers simple commands for manipulating the database and updating the content displayed on the front-end interface.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python
